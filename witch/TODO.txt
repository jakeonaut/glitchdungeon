0. BEFORE COMMITTING TO GITHUB!!! hide the private key and stuff of the game in the trophy section (new file not in github)
1. default to audio objects if the audiocontext is taking a long time to load the songs
2. land sound is corrupt in not chrome
3. clean up level editor: (and have a seperate web page to the editor from the main game)
	-export HOUSE option as linkable html thing to share with friends
	-drop down selector for objects is dynamic to also be for tile type, and npc and item can select dialog and event?
4. Future of Glitch Dungeon::
	-If ever to make an expanded version, here are some things:
		1. introduce secret spells as normal spells
		2. Make more use out of death to checkpoint mechanism for travel with above
		3. Make more nonlinear and allow much more sequence breaking
		4. AS left right cycling through spells
		5. Gaining a new spell alters the world (like glitched rooms)
		6. Collect the sword in glitch dungeon 2
